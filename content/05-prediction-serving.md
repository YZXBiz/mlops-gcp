# Prediction Serving

In the prediction serving process, after the model is deployed to its target environment, the model service starts to accept prediction requests (serving data) and to serve responses with predictions.

The prediction serving process is a critical component that handles the actual inference requests in production. The serving engine must be robust, scalable, and capable of handling various types of prediction patterns while maintaining low latency and high throughput.

## Serving Patterns and Deployment Types

::::{admonition} Forms of Prediction Serving
:class: tip
The serving engine can serve predictions to consumers in the following forms:

- **Online inference:** Near real-time for high-frequency singleton or mini-batch requests (via REST or gRPC)
- **Streaming inference:** Near real-time through event-processing pipelines
- **Offline batch inference:** For bulk data scoring, usually integrated with ETL processes
- **Embedded inference:** As part of embedded systems or edge devices
  ::::

### Online Inference Details

```{mermaid}
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant API Gateway
    participant Serving Engine
    participant Feature Store
    participant Model
    participant Logs

    Client->>API Gateway: POST /predict
    API Gateway->>Serving Engine: Forward request
    Serving Engine->>Feature Store: Lookup features
    Feature Store-->>Serving Engine: Return features
    Serving Engine->>Model: Inference call
    Model-->>Serving Engine: Prediction result
    Serving Engine->>Logs: Log request/response
    Serving Engine-->>API Gateway: Return prediction
    API Gateway-->>Client: JSON response
```

Online inference is the most common pattern for real-time applications where predictions are needed immediately to support user interactions or business processes.

::::{important} Online Inference Requirements

- **Low latency:** Typically under 100ms for user-facing applications
- **High availability:** 99.9%+ uptime requirements
- **Auto-scaling:** Handle traffic spikes automatically
- **Load balancing:** Distribute requests across multiple model instances
- **Circuit breakers:** Fail gracefully when dependencies are unavailable
  ::::

### Batch Inference Considerations

::::{admonition} Batch Processing Benefits
:class: tip
Batch inference is optimal when:

- Processing large volumes of data at once
- Predictions don't need to be real-time
- Cost optimization is important (batch jobs can use cheaper compute)
- Integration with existing ETL/data pipeline workflows
  ::::

## Feature Lookup and Data Integration

::::{important} Feature Lookups during Serving
In many scenarios, the serving engine needs to look up feature values related to the request. For example:

**Use case:** A recommendation model that predicts customer purchase propensity

- **Request contains:** `customer_id` and `product_id`
- **Required features:** Customer demographics, purchase history, product attributes, market trends
- **Process:** The serving engine fetches these features from the feature repository and combines them with the request data

This pattern helps maintain **training-serving consistency** by using the same feature definitions and transformations used during training.
::::

::::{warning} Training-Serving Skew Prevention
To avoid training-serving skew:

- Use the same feature repository for both training and serving
- Ensure feature transformations are identical between environments
- Validate that feature schemas match between training and serving data
- Monitor for feature drift and distribution changes

::::{important} Model Explanations
An important part of having confidence in ML systems is being able to interpret the models and provide explanations for their predictions. This includes:

- **Feature attributions:** How much each feature contributed to the prediction
- **Local explanations:** Why this specific prediction was made
- **Global explanations:** How the model behaves in general
- **Confidence scores:** How certain the model is about its prediction
  ::::

::::{admonition} Explanation Techniques
:class: tip
Common techniques for generating explanations:

- **SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations):** Unified approach to explain predictions
- **LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations):** Local surrogate models
- **Integrated Gradients:** Attribution method for deep neural networks
- **Permutation Importance:** Feature importance by measuring performance drop
  ::::

## Serving Infrastructure and Scaling

::::{admonition} Infrastructure Components
:class: note
A robust prediction serving infrastructure typically includes:

- **Load balancers:** Distribute traffic across model instances
- **API gateways:** Handle authentication, rate limiting, and routing
- **Model servers:** Host and run the actual models
- **Feature stores:** Provide real-time feature lookups
- **Caching layers:** Cache frequently accessed features and predictions
- **Monitoring systems:** Track performance and detect issues
  ::::

### Scaling Strategies

::::{important} Auto-Scaling Considerations
Effective auto-scaling for ML serving requires:

- **Predictive scaling:** Anticipate traffic patterns based on historical data
- **Metric-based scaling:** Scale based on latency, throughput, and resource utilization
- **Model warm-up:** Pre-load models to avoid cold start delays
- **Graceful shutdown:** Allow in-flight requests to complete during scale-down
  ::::

## Logging and Monitoring Integration

::::{admonition} Comprehensive Logging Strategy
:class: tip
The serving system should log:

- **Request data:** Input features and metadata
- **Response data:** Predictions and confidence scores
- **Performance metrics:** Latency, throughput, error rates
- **Feature attributions:** For debugging and auditing
- **System metrics:** Resource utilization, memory usage
- **Business metrics:** Conversion rates, revenue impact
  ::::

The inference logs and other serving metrics are stored for continuous monitoring and analysis, enabling:

- **Performance tracking:** Monitor prediction quality over time
- **Drift detection:** Identify when input data changes
- **Debugging:** Investigate prediction issues
- **Business analysis:** Measure model impact on business outcomes
