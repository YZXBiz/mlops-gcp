# Dataset and Feature Management

One of the key challenges of data science and ML is creating, maintaining, and reusing high-quality data for training. Data scientists spend a significant amount of their ML development time on exploratory data analysis, data preparation, and data transformation.

Dataset and feature management helps mitigate common data challenges by providing a unified repository for ML features and datasets. This centralized approach enables standardized definitions, reduces duplicate work, and ensures consistency across training and serving environments.

::::{warning} Common Challenges
Without proper dataset and feature management, teams face:

- **Duplicated effort:** Teams re-create the same datasets for similar use cases, leading to wasted time and inconsistent data definitions
- **Training-serving skew:** Discrepancies between training and serving data can negatively impact model performance
- **Data silos:** Features developed by one team are not discoverable or reusable by others
- **Inconsistent definitions:** Same business entities defined differently across teams
- **Manual processes:** Time-consuming manual data preparation and feature engineering
- **Quality issues:** Lack of standardized data validation and quality checks

::::{admonition} What is a Feature?
:class: tip
Features are attributes of business entities (e.g., product, customer, location, promotion) that are cleansed and prepared based on standard business rulesâ€”aggregations, derivations, flags, and transformations.

**Examples of feature types:**

- **Demographic features:** Age group, location, income level
- **Behavioral features:** Purchase frequency, click-through rates, session duration
- **Derived features:** Recency, frequency, monetary value (RFM) scores
- **Temporal features:** Seasonality indicators, time since last action
- **Contextual features:** Device type, geographic location, time of day
  ::::

### Feature Repository Benefits

A central feature repository helps data scientists and researchers:

- **Discover and reuse** available feature sets instead of re-creating entities
- **Establish central definitions** of features with standardized business logic
- **Avoid training-serving skew** by using the same data source for experimentation, training, and serving
- **Serve up-to-date feature values** from a single source of truth
- **Define and share new features** through standardized processes
- **Improve collaboration** between data science and research teams

::::{important} Feature Serving Requirements
**Batch serving** requirements:

- High throughput for large dataset processing
- Cost-effective for bulk operations
- Integration with existing ETL workflows
- Support for complex aggregations and joins

**Online serving** requirements:

- Low latency (typically <10ms for feature lookup)
- High availability and reliability
- Efficient caching and indexing
- Support for real-time feature updates

:::{note}
Features can be used in many datasets for multiple ML use cases, while a dataset is used for a particular ML task. A dataset combines features from different entities and joins them with other data (like labels) to create a dataset for a specific task.

**Key distinction:**

- **Feature Repository:** Contains reusable feature values of various entities
- **Dataset:** Combines features with labels for a specific ML task or use case
  :::

### Multi-Use Case Feature Reuse

::::{admonition} Feature Reuse Example
:class: tip
Consider a **customer entity** in the feature repository that includes:

- Demographics (age, location, income)
- Purchase behavior (frequency, recency, monetary value)
- Social media interactions (sentiment scores, engagement)
- Third-party data (credit scores, external flags)

This customer entity can be used across multiple ML tasks:

- **Churn prediction:** Customer features + historical usage + churn labels
- **Click-through rate prediction:** Customer features + product features + interaction labels
- **Customer lifetime value:** Customer features + transaction history + CLV labels
- **Recommendation systems:** Customer features + product affinity + preference labels
  ::::

### Dataset Management Capabilities

Dataset management helps with:

::::{important} Core Dataset Management Functions

- **Environment consistency:** Maintaining scripts for creating datasets and splits across different environments (development, test, production)
- **Single source of truth:** Maintaining one dataset definition and realization within the team for various model implementations and hyperparameter experiments
- **Collaboration support:** Maintaining metadata and annotations useful for team members collaborating on the same dataset and task
- **Reproducibility:** Providing lineage tracking and versioning for reproducible experiments
- **Quality assurance:** Implementing data validation and quality checks at the dataset level

::::{admonition} Advanced Dataset Techniques
:class: tip
**Time-based splitting:** Ensures temporal consistency by splitting data chronologically

- Training: Historical data (e.g., 2020-2022)
- Validation: Recent past (e.g., Q1 2023)
- Test: Most recent data (e.g., Q2 2023)

**Stratified splitting:** Maintains class distribution across splits

- Important for imbalanced datasets
- Ensures representative samples in each split

**Cross-validation datasets:** Enable robust model evaluation

- K-fold cross-validation for model selection
- Time series cross-validation for temporal data

::::{warning} Training-Serving Skew Prevention
Training-serving skew occurs when there are discrepancies between the data used for training and the data encountered during serving. This can be prevented by:

- **Consistent data sources:** Use the same feature repository for both training and serving
- **Schema alignment:** Ensure feature schemas match between training and serving environments
- **Distribution monitoring:** Track feature distributions and detect drift
- **Transformation consistency:** Apply identical feature transformations in both environments
- **Version synchronization:** Keep feature definitions synchronized across environments
