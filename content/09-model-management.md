# Model Management

As organizations add to the number of models in production at scale, it becomes difficult to keep track of all of them manually. Organizations need controls to manage risk, implement ML models responsibly, and maintain compliance with regulations.

Robust **model management** is a cross-cutting process at the center of MLOps that entails both **ML metadata tracking** and **model governance**. This comprehensive approach ensures that models are developed, deployed, and maintained with proper oversight and control.

::::{important} Goals of Model Management
Model management across the ML lifecycle helps ensure:

- **Data accuracy:** The data being collected and used for model training and evaluation is accurate, unbiased, and used appropriately without data privacy violations
- **Model quality:** Models are evaluated and validated against effectiveness quality measures and fairness indicators, ensuring they are fit for deployment
- **Interpretability:** Models are interpretable, and their outcomes are explainable when needed
- **Performance tracking:** The performance of deployed models is monitored using continuous evaluation with metrics tracked and reported
- **Debuggability:** Potential issues in model training or prediction serving are traceable, debuggable, and reproducible

## ML Metadata Tracking Deep Dive

ML metadata tracking is generally integrated with different MLOps processes, with artifacts automatically stored in an ML artifact repository along with information about process executions.

:::{note}
Captured ML metadata can include:

- **Process information:** Pipeline run ID, trigger type, process type, step name
- **Temporal data:** Start and end datetime, execution duration
- **Status tracking:** Success/failure status, error messages
- **Configuration:** Environment configurations, input parameter values
- **Artifacts:** Processed data splits, schemas, statistics, hyperparameters, models, evaluation metrics

## Model Governance Comprehensive Framework

Model governance is about registering, reviewing, validating, and approving models for deployment. The process can be automated, semi-automated, or fully manual, with multiple release criteria in all cases.
