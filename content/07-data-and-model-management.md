# Data and Model Management

At the heart of the MLOps processes is **data and model management**. This is a central function for governing ML artifacts to support auditability, traceability, and compliance, as well as shareability, reusability, and discoverability of ML assets.

## Data and Model Management Architecture

Data and model management serves as the foundation that enables all other MLOps processes to function effectively. Without proper governance of ML artifacts, organizations struggle with reproducibility, compliance, and scaling their ML initiatives.

## Key Challenges Addressed

::::{warning} Common Data and Model Management Challenges

- **Data silos**: Teams recreate the same datasets for similar use cases
- **Inconsistent definitions**: Same data entities defined differently across teams
- **Training-serving skew**: Discrepancies between training and production data
- **Model tracking**: Difficulty keeping track of models in production at scale
- **Compliance gaps**: Lack of audit trails and governance controls
- **Resource waste**: Duplicated effort in data preparation and model development
  ::::

::::{important} Benefits of Centralized Management
Proper data and model management helps ensure:

- **Data accuracy**: Collected and used data is accurate, unbiased, and appropriate
- **Model quality**: Models are evaluated against effectiveness and fairness indicators
- **Interpretability**: Models and outcomes are explainable when needed
- **Performance tracking**: Deployed model performance is continuously monitored
- **Debuggability**: Issues in training or serving are traceable and reproducible
- **Regulatory compliance**: Adherence to data privacy and algorithmic fairness requirements

The diagram above shows how data flows through the system and how different artifacts are created, stored, and reused across the ML lifecycle. Notice the central role of the feature repository, model registry, and metadata store in enabling this flow.

## Repository Integration Patterns

```{mermaid}

    A[Batch ETL Systems] --> B[Feature Repository]
    C[Streaming Systems] --> B
    D[Monitoring Service] --> B

    B --> E[Training Pipeline - Batch Retrieval]
    B --> F[Serving Engine - Real-time Lookup]

    G[Experiment Results] --> H[Model Registry]
    I[Training Pipeline Output] --> H

    H --> J[Model Deployment Service]
    J --> K[Production Serving]

    L[All Processes] --> M[ML Metadata Repository]
    M --> N[Lineage Tracking]
    M --> O[Audit Reports]
    M --> P[Reproducibility Support]

    style B fill:#e8f5e8
    style H fill:#e1f5fe
    style M fill:#fff3e0
```

This integration pattern shows how the three core repositories (Dataset & Feature, Model Registry, ML Metadata) work together to support the entire ML lifecycle with proper governance and traceability.
