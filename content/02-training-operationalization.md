# Training Operationalization

Training operationalization is the process of `building and testing a repeatable ML training pipeline` and then `deploying it to a target execution environment.`

::::{admonition} Deployment Configurations
:class: tip
For MLOps, ML engineers should be able to use configurations to deploy the ML pipelines. The configurations specify variables like:

- The target deployment environment (development, test, staging, etc.)
- The data sources to access during execution in each environment
- The service account to use for running compute workloads
- Compute resources and scaling parameters
- Security and access policies
  ::::

A pipeline typically goes through a series of testing and staging environments before it is released to production. The number of testing and staging environments varies depending on standards established in the organization.

As illustrated in {numref}`training-operationalization-fig`, this process ensures quality and reliability through systematic validation at each stage.

## Continuous Integration (CI) Deep Dive

### CI Testing Strategies

::::{admonition} Comprehensive CI Testing
:class: important
The CI process should include multiple types of tests:

**Unit Testing:**

- Test feature engineering logic and data transformation functions
- Test individual model components and methods (e.g., categorical encoding functions)
- Validate mathematical operations and statistical computations

**Integration Testing:**

- Test integration between pipeline components
- Verify data flow between pipeline steps
- Test component interfaces and contracts

**Model Testing:**

- Test that model training converges (loss decreases over iterations)
- Test model training doesn't produce NaN values
- Test model can overfit on a few sample records (sanity check)
- Validate that each component produces expected artifacts

```

::::{warning} Common CI Test Failures
Watch out for these common issues:

- **Dependency conflicts:** Version mismatches between development and CI environments
- **Data schema changes:** Tests failing due to unexpected data format changes
- **Resource limitations:** Tests failing due to insufficient compute or memory in CI environment
- **Flaky tests:** Non-deterministic failures due to random seeds or timing issues
  ::::

## Continuous Delivery (CD) Deep Dive

### Multi-Environment Strategy

::::{admonition} Environment Progression
:class: tip
**Test Environment:**

- Automated deployment triggered by successful CI
- Run on subset of production data
- Focus on functionality and integration testing

**Staging Environment:**

- Semi-automated deployment (requires approval)
- Mirror of production environment
- Full-scale testing with production-like data volumes

**Production Environment:**

- Manual deployment with additional approvals
- Gradual rollout with monitoring and rollback capabilities
- Full production data and traffic
  ::::

### CD Validation Checklist

Before deploying to each environment, the CD process should verify:

::::{important} Pre-Deployment Validation
**Infrastructure Compatibility:**

- Required packages and dependencies are available
- Compute resources (CPU, GPU, memory) are sufficient
- Storage and networking requirements are met
- Security permissions and service accounts are properly configured

**Model Compatibility:**

- Model accepts expected input format
- Model produces expected output format
- Model latency meets performance requirements
- Model size is within deployment limits

**Data Validation:**

- Training data quality checks pass
- Data schema matches expectations
- Feature distributions are within acceptable ranges
- No data leakage or privacy violations

## Technology-Specific Considerations

::::{admonition} Implementation Approaches
:class: note
**No-Code/Low-Code Solutions:**

- Deployment process is streamlined and abstracted
- Data scientists don't handle deployment details
- Platform handles infrastructure provisioning automatically

**Code-First Approaches:**

- More flexibility and control over ML pipelines
- Requires expertise in CI/CD tools and practices
- Enables custom testing and deployment strategies
- Better suited for complex, custom ML workflows
  ::::

### Pipeline Deployment Artifacts

::::{admonition} Typical Assets Produced
:class: seealso
**Training Pipeline Executables:**

- Container images stored in container registries
- Python packages or JAR files in artifact repositories
- Configuration files and environment specifications

**Pipeline Runtime Representation:**

- Workflow definitions (e.g., Kubeflow, Airflow DAGs)
- Pipeline metadata and dependency graphs
- Resource requirements and scaling configurations
  ::::

### Fallback and Recovery Strategies

::::{warning} Production Safety Measures
**Deployment Safety:**

- Smoke testing of newly deployed pipelines
- Automatic fallback to previous pipeline version on failure
- Blue-green deployment strategies for zero-downtime updates
- Canary deployments for gradual rollout

**Monitoring and Alerting:**

- Pipeline execution monitoring and logging
- Performance metrics tracking (execution time, resource usage)
- Automated alerts for pipeline failures or anomalies
- Integration with incident management systems
