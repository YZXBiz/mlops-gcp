# MLOps Processes - Comprehensive Guide

Welcome to the comprehensive guide on **Machine Learning Operations (MLOps)** processes. This guide provides detailed insights into the core MLOps processes, based on the _Practitioners Guide to MLOps_ by Google Cloud.

MLOps is a set of standardized processes and technology capabilities for building, deploying, and operationalizing ML systems rapidly and reliably. It unifies ML system development with ML system operations, advocating for formalizing and automating critical steps of ML system construction.

## MLOps Maturity Levels

Understanding MLOps maturity is crucial for implementing the right level of automation for your organization. The [Google Cloud MLOps framework](https://cloud.google.com/architecture/mlops-continuous-delivery-and-automation-pipelines-in-machine-learning) defines three levels of MLOps maturity:

### Level 0: Manual Process

::::{admonition} Manual MLOps Characteristics
:class: warning

- **Manual, script-driven process:** Every step is manual, including data analysis, model preparation, and validation
- **Disconnect between ML and operations:** Data scientists work in isolation using notebooks or experiments
- **Infrequent release iterations:** New model versions are deployed only a few times per year
- **No CI/CD:** No automated testing or deployment
- **Active performance monitoring lacking:** Models deployed as prediction services with minimal monitoring
  ::::

**Common in organizations starting their ML journey**, but faces challenges with model degradation over time and difficulty scaling to multiple models.

### Level 1: ML Pipeline Automation

::::{admonition} Automated ML Pipeline Characteristics
:class: tip

- **Rapid experiment iteration:** Enables data scientists to rapidly try out new ideas
- **CT (Continuous Training) of the model:** Automatic retraining and deployment of models
- **Experimental-operational symmetry:** Training pipeline used in both development and production
- **Modular code for components:** Reusable and shareable pipeline components
- **Pipeline deployment:** Deploys pipelines to production, not just models
- **Automated model deployment:** New models automatically deployed to production
- **Active model and data monitoring:** Continuous monitoring for model performance and data drift
  ::::

**Recommended for organizations** with multiple models or when model performance degrades quickly due to changing data patterns.

### Level 2: CI/CD Pipeline Automation

::::{admonition} Full CI/CD MLOps Characteristics
:class: important

- **Source control integration:** All code versioned in Git repositories
- **Test and build services:** Automated testing of ML pipeline components
- **Deployment services:** Automated deployment to multiple environments
- **Model and dataset versioning:** Complete artifact management
- **Feature store integration:** Centralized feature management
- **ML metadata store:** Comprehensive experiment and model tracking
  ::::

**Essential for organizations** with rapidly changing requirements, multiple teams, and complex ML systems requiring frequent updates and reliable deployments.
