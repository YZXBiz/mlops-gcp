## 🎯 What You'll Learn

This guide covers the essential MLOps processes with detailed explanations and visual diagrams:

### 🏗️ MLOps Maturity Levels

- **Level 0:** Manual Process
- **Level 1:** ML Pipeline Automation
- **Level 2:** CI/CD Pipeline Automation

### 🔧 Core MLOps Processes

1. **ML Development** - Experimentation, prototyping, and pipeline implementation
2. **Training Operationalization** - CI/CD for training pipelines
3. **Continuous Training** - Automated retraining and validation
4. **Model Deployment** - Progressive delivery and governance
5. **Prediction Serving** - Production inference and scaling
6. **Continuous Monitoring** - Performance tracking and drift detection
7. **Data and Model Management** - Central governance and artifact management
8. **Dataset and Feature Management** - Data asset lifecycle and quality
9. **Model Management** - Model governance, metadata, and lifecycle

## 🎨 Features

- **📊 Interactive Mermaid Diagrams** - Visual workflows and architectures
- **🎯 Best Practices** - Industry-proven strategies and recommendations
- **⚠️ Common Pitfalls** - Warnings and tips to avoid common mistakes
- **🔗 Real-world Examples** - Practical implementation guidance
- **📱 Mobile-Friendly** - Responsive design for reading on any device

## 🚀 Local Development

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- pip or conda

### Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YZXBiz/mlops-gcp.git
   cd mlops-gcp
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Build the book:**

   ```bash
   jupyter-book build .
   ```

4. **View locally:**
   ```bash
   # Open _build/html/index.html in your browser
   open _build/html/index.html  # macOS
   # or
   xdg-open _build/html/index.html  # Linux
   ```

### Development Workflow

- **Edit content:** Modify files in the `content/` directory
- **Update config:** Edit `_config.yml` for site configuration
- **Update TOC:** Edit `_toc.yml` for navigation structure
- **Rebuild:** Run `jupyter-book build .` to see changes
